Let vs Const
Difference between let and const.
let const
It can be declared without
initialization.
It can’t be declared without initialization.
e.g. const val; //It is not allowed.
It can’t be accessed without
initialization, as it returns an error
const can’t be accessed without
initialisation, as it can’t be declared without
initialisation.
It can be updated but cannot be
re-declared into the scope.
It cannot be updated or re-declared into the
scope.
Note: Sometimes, we face the problem while working with the var variable as they
change its value in the particular block. So, we should use the let and const
keywords to declare a variable in JavaScript.
